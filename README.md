## 1) Application of Arrays

#### Basics
* Sparse matrices

## 2) Linked Lists

### Basics
* Insert element at head
* Insert element at the tail
* Insert element at any position
* Count number of nodes
* Search for an element 
* Delete first element
* Delete last element
* Delete an element at a given position
* Implement Circular linked list
* Implement Doubly linked list

### Easy
* Reverse a linked list
* Merge two sorted linked lists
* Swap any two nodes
* Print middle node
* Swap head and tail
* Count even and odd nodes
* Concatenate two linked lists
* Swap first half with second half
* Find predecessor and successor nodes

### Medium
* Insert into sorted linked list
* Sort a linked list
* Remove duplicates from linked list
* Remove all occurences of a given element
* Copy common elements into third linked list


### Advanced
* Detect cycle in a linked list
* Rotate linked list by k places
