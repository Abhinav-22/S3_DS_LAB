## 1) Application of Arrays

#### Basics
* Sparse matrix Addition
* Sparse matrix multilplication
* Polynomial addition
* Polynomial multiplication

## 2) Linked Lists

### Basics
* Insert element at head

* Insert element at any position
* Count number of nodes
* Search for an element 
* Delete first element
* Delete last element
* Delete an element at a given position
* Implement Circular linked list
* Implement Doubly linked list

### Easy
* Reverse a linked list
* Merge two sorted linked lists
* Swap any two nodes
* Print middle node
* Swap head and tail
* Count number of nodes in circular linked lists
* Count even and odd nodes
* Concatenate two linked lists
* Swap first half with second half
* Find predecessor and successor nodes

### Medium
* Insert into sorted linked list

* Remove all occurences of a given element
* Copy common elements into third linked list
* Split into 3 linked list based on value
* Check if a list of words form a palindrome
* Find distance between two given nodes in a circular linked list

### Hard

## 4) Hashing Algorithms

### Basics
* Insert set of keys into a hash table of given size using division method and linear probing.
