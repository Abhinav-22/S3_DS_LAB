## 1) Application of Arrays

#### Basics
* Sparse matrix Addition
* Sparse matrix multilplication
* Polynomial addition
* Polynomial multiplication

## 2) Linked Lists

### Basics
* Insert element at head
* Insert element at the tail
* Insert element at any position
* Count number of nodes
* Search for an element 
* Delete first element
* Delete last element
* Delete an element at a given position
* Implement Circular linked list
* Implement Doubly linked list

### Easy
* Reverse a linked list
* Merge two sorted linked lists
* Swap any two nodes
* Print middle node
* Swap head and tail
* Count even and odd nodes
* Concatenate two linked lists
* Swap first half with second half
* Find predecessor and successor nodes

### Medium

## 4) Hashing Algorithms

### Basics
* Insert set of keys into a hash table of given size using division method and linear probing.
* Store each words of a natural language text in a hash table of given size using the mod function and perform search. 

## 5) Sorting Algorithms

### Basics
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort

* Level order Traversal
* Find height, number of nodes and number of vertices
* Implement Binary Search Tree (BST)
* Insertion, Deletion, Searching in BST

### Easy
* Create linked representation of binary tree from sequential and vice versa
* Find minimum and maximum in a BST
* Count leaf nodes

### Medium
